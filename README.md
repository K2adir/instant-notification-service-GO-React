Due to inactivity, the backend may stop running.
You might need to visit https://instant-notification.onrender.com/
 and wait for about a minute to bring it online again.

Although I’ve implemented an auto wake-up system in the frontend (https://instant-notification.vercel.app/
), which should trigger when you visit it, I wasn’t able to fully test it while writing this README.

Just keep this in mind.
